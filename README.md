# Reflections 🖥️🛠️
### What I've gained from the PC assemble:
By assembling a PC, I've gained a solid understanding of how hardware and software components work together to create a fully functional computing system. 🤓 Additionally, I've acquired valuable skills in problem-solving and troubleshooting, which have helped me address technical issues that may arise during the assembly process. Furthermore, by learning how to build a PC from scratch, I've developed knowledge and experience that can be applied to future technological advancements. 🚀
I realized the immense value of the hands-on experience provided in this course. Not only did I learn valuable technical skills, but I also developed a strong foundation of knowledge and understanding. This course was a fantastic experience and one that I will never forget. 🌐

### Suggest any improvement:
To improve the PC Assemble Lab session, we should focus on smaller tasks and quicker assembly times, making the assembly process more efficient and engaging for students. ⏱️ We should also incorporate multiple computer configurations with varying assembly constraints, levels of difficulty, and unique features, offering students a variety of challenges and learning opportunities. 🎓

### Others:
We could try to make this experience more engaging by introducing a new challenge where teams that complete early are tasked with an extra project. For example, they could take newer sets of PCs and disassemble them to analyze the differences between old and new PCs. This approach not only adds an extra layer of challenge but also helps foster curiosity and interest in the topic. 🕵️‍♂️💡
